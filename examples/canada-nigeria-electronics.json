  "DECK_SUBTITLE": "Class 6 Activity: Context Brief · Claim Ladder · Evidence · Plan",

  "COURSE_INFO": "TIMG 5203 — Cross-Border Business &amp; Digital Innovation",
  "TERM_INFO": "Winter 2026 · Professor Eduardo Bailetti",
  "TEAM_LABEL": "Group 5:",
  "TEAM_MEMBERS": "Abdullahi · Jayeola · Gideon · Rauf",

  "CTX_ORGANIZATION": "A Canada-based digital coordination platform connecting Canadian refurbished electronics suppliers with verified Nigerian device resellers in Southwest Nigeria.",
  "CTX_USE_CASE": "Pre-shipment orchestration — verified listing, landed-cost certainty, shipment execution — because it drives transaction value by eliminating pricing opacity and trust friction blocking cross-border refurbished electronics trade.",
  "CTX_CROSS_BORDER": "Spans Canada and Nigeria. What crosses: DATA (listings, IMEI, grades), MONEY (payments, duties, fees), GOODS (phones/tablets), SERVICE (orchestration), IP (verification algorithms).",
  "CTX_TECHNOLOGY": "PIPE 17's interoperability engine replaces manual WhatsApp negotiation and opaque cost estimation with automated device verification, transparent landed-cost calculation, and structured transaction orchestration.",
  "CTX_WEDGE": "Nigeria differs on import duty unpredictability (ECOWAS tariff, customs discretion), device certification (NCC type-approval), payment infrastructure (naira liquidity, FX volatility), logistics reliability (port delays) — requiring localized orchestration and shifting value from efficiency toward trust assurance and risk reduction.",
  "CTX_VALUE_THESIS": "If resellers adopt verified listings and landed-cost estimates prove accurate within ±10%, value is created via (1) higher transaction conversion from transparency and (2) reduced failed shipments — constrained by NCC compliance timelines and naira-CAD FX volatility.",

  "CLAIM_1_TECH": "PIPE 17 automates device verification (IMEI, grading), landed-cost calculation (unit + shipping + duty + NCC fees + FX margin), and transaction orchestration across fragmented APIs.",
  "CLAIM_2_WORKFLOW": "Manual WhatsApp sourcing → structured pre-shipment orchestration: verified listing → landed-cost quote → conditional payment → shipment. Compliance verification becomes the new bottleneck.",
  "CLAIM_3_MECHANISM": "Automated landed-cost calculation removes information asymmetry between supplier pricing and buyer total cost. Pre-shipment verification reduces post-arrival dispute rates.",
  "CLAIM_4_VALUE_CREATION": "Suppliers: 20–35% higher transaction conversion. Resellers: 10–20% working capital recovery (currently lost to pricing surprises, customs holds, unverified quality).",
  "CLAIM_5_VALUE_CAPTURE": "Suppliers: margin stability via reliable demand. Resellers: sourcing reliability. Platform: 2–4% orchestration fee. Switching costs sustain capture.",
  "CLAIM_6_CROSS_BORDER": "Duty unpredictability, FX volatility (5–15% monthly), NCC type-approval, payment friction → value shifts from transaction speed to <em>trust assurance and cost predictability</em>.",
