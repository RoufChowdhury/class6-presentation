# Cross-Border Electronics Expert Agent Skill

## Overview

This agent skill provides specialized expertise in Canada-Nigeria electronics trade, cross-border business orchestration, and the PIPE 17 platform operations. It's designed to support analysis, planning, and decision-making for the Canada-Nigeria Verified Electronics Bridge project.

## Quick Start

### Using in Claude Code

1. **Locate the Agent Skill**: The agent configuration is stored in `.github/agents/cross-border-electronics-expert.json`

2. **Activate the Agent**: Reference this agent skill when working on cross-border electronics trade topics

3. **Example Prompts**:
   - "Calculate the landed cost for shipping 100 refurbished iPhone 12s from Toronto to Lagos"
   - "What are the key NCC compliance requirements for importing tablets into Nigeria?"
   - "Compare the current manual WhatsApp workflow with the PIPE 17 automated workflow"
   - "Analyze the FX risk for a monthly trade volume of $50,000 CAD"

## Agent Capabilities

### Core Competencies

1. **Cross-Border Trade Analysis**
   - Supply chain mapping between Canada and Nigeria
   - Five cross-border flow tracking: DATA, MONEY, GOODS, SERVICE, IP
   - Multi-stakeholder value analysis

2. **Financial Calculations**
   - Landed cost estimation (unit + shipping + duties + NCC fees + FX margin)
   - FX volatility modeling (5-15% monthly CAD-NGN)
   - Platform fee optimization (2-4% target)

3. **Compliance & Regulatory**
   - NCC (Nigerian Communications Commission) type-approval guidance
   - ECOWAS customs tariff framework
   - CBN foreign exchange regulations

4. **Technology Platform**
   - PIPE 17 orchestration engine features
   - IMEI verification systems
   - Payment gateway integration (Flutterwave, Paystack)

5. **Workflow Optimization**
   - Current state: Manual WhatsApp negotiation (15-30% cost errors)
   - Future state: Automated pre-shipment orchestration
   - Transaction flow design

## Decision Frameworks

### Claim Ladder Methodology

The agent uses a structured 6-level approach to analyze technology value:

1. **Technology Capability** - What the technology does
2. **Workflow Change** - How processes transform
3. **Mechanism** - Why value is created
4. **Value Creation** - How much value for whom
5. **Value Capture** - Who gets the value and how
6. **Cross-Border Adjustment** - How borders change the value equation

### Evidence-Based Analysis

For each claim, the agent:
- Identifies what would falsify the claim
- Specifies required evidence sources
- References academic and industry data

## Knowledge Domains

### Geographic Focus
- **Canada**: Supply side, refurbished electronics suppliers
- **Nigeria**: Southwest region demand, device resellers and end consumers

### Product Specialization
- Refurbished phones and tablets
- IMEI tracking and verification
- Device condition grading systems

### Key Challenges Addressed
1. Import duty unpredictability (ECOWAS tariff, customs discretion)
2. NCC type-approval requirements
3. FX volatility (5-15% monthly)
4. Payment infrastructure limitations
5. Port delays and logistics reliability

## Value Metrics

### Success Criteria
- **Landed-cost accuracy**: ±10% target
- **Supplier conversion**: 20-35% improvement
- **Reseller capital recovery**: 10-20%
- **Platform fee**: 2-4% orchestration fee
- **Dispute reduction**: Measurable decrease

### Stakeholder Value
- **Suppliers**: Margin stability, reliable demand
- **Resellers**: Working capital recovery, sourcing reliability
- **Platform**: Orchestration fee, switching cost sustainability
- **Consumers**: Quality assurance, price transparency

## Data Sources & Tools

### Primary Systems
- PIPE 17 interoperability engine
- Nigerian customs tariff databases
- CBN foreign exchange tracking
- NCC type-approval systems

### Analytics & Research
- UN Comtrade (HS codes 8517, 8471)
- World Bank Enterprise Surveys
- GSMA mobile economy reports
- Academic literature on African B2B trade

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Cost Calculation
```
Prompt: "Calculate landed cost for 50 iPhone 11 Pro units from Vancouver to Ibadan"

Agent Response:
- Unit cost (CAD)
- Shipping cost (freight + insurance)
- Import duties (ECOWAS tariff HS 8517.12)
- NCC type-approval fees
- FX conversion (official vs parallel rate)
- Platform orchestration fee
= Total landed cost per unit
```

### 2. Workflow Design
```
Prompt: "Design the optimal transaction flow for a first-time reseller"

Agent Response:
1. Supplier lists devices (IMEI, grade)
2. PIPE 17 verifies listing
3. Reseller browses verified catalog
4. Landed-cost calculation
5. Conditional payment (escrow)
6. Shipment + compliance clearance
7. Settlement to supplier (CAD)
```

### 3. Risk Assessment
```
Prompt: "What are the top 3 risks for this cross-border model?"

Agent Response:
1. FX volatility: 5-15% monthly swings impact margins
2. NCC compliance delays: Type-approval can bottleneck shipments
3. Customs duty discretion: ECOWAS framework not uniformly applied
```

## Interaction Style

The agent provides:
- **Data-driven analysis**: Metrics and quantitative assessments
- **Evidence-based reasoning**: Falsifiable claims with source citations
- **Multi-stakeholder perspective**: Considers all parties in the value chain
- **Actionable insights**: Specific recommendations with timelines

## Context & Background

### Academic Framework
- Course: TIMG 5203 - Cross-Border Business & Digital Innovation
- Professor: Eduardo Bailetti

### Project Focus
The Canada-Nigeria Verified Electronics Bridge is a digital coordination platform connecting Canadian refurbished electronics suppliers with verified Nigerian device resellers, addressing pricing opacity and trust friction in cross-border trade.

## Limitations

The agent acknowledges these constraints:
1. Real-time FX rates require external API access
2. Exact customs duties need specific HS code classification
3. NCC timelines vary by device type
4. Platform fee tolerance requires primary market research
5. Transaction conversion metrics require pilot data
